# This project was created for my final examination during my programming course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It focuses on solving the Knight's Tour problem, a classic chessboard puzzle.

# Description

Knight's Tour is a chessboard puzzle that lets you explore and visualize a knight's movements. The goal is to find the longest possible path where the knight visits each square exactly once.  

The game has two main modes:  

- **Create Route:** Design your own path for the knight, experimenting with different strategies.  
- **Longest Route:** Find the longest possible path from a given starting position. This mode uses Warnsdorff's rule, a heuristic algorithm, to optimize the knight's journey.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.11 or later
Tkinter library for GUI

# Result
I received the highest grade for this work. Please read "specification.md" for further information (in Swedish).
