# This project was created for my final examination during my programming course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It focuses on solving the Knight's Tour problem, a classic chessboard puzzle.

Knight's Tour

Description
Knight's Tour is a chessboard game that allows you to explore and visualize the movements of a knight on a chessboard. The objective is to find the longest possible route for a knight, visiting each square only once.

The game is divided into two main parts:

Create Route: Users can create their own path for the knight, giving them the freedom to explore different strategies.
Longest Route: Discover the longest possible route a knight can take, given a starting position. The feature uses Warnsdorff's rule (a heuristic algorithm) to calculate the longest route.
